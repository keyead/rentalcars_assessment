# rentalcars_assessment
My solution to the task presented by rentalcars.com in advance of their assessment day.

- Run java -jar build/libs/restful-vehicles.jar
- Visit http://localhost:8080/search in browser to view results to all queries.
- http://localhost:8080/search?section=1 (1-4) will allow for individual queries.

The java file (JSONToJava.java) in root is a standalone solution to part 1 that can be run through console.
